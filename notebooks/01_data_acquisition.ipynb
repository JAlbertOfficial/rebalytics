    "# 1. Data Source and Asset Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this analysis is sourced from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` Python library, which provides reliable access to historical price data for a wide range of financial assets. The data is retrieved at a monthly frequency to align with long-term investment perspectives, minimizing the impact of short-term volatility while focusing on trends and asset performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected assets represent an ultra-diversified portfolio designed to achieve broad diversification across various dimensions, including geographies, sectors, asset classes, and investment strategies. The aim is not only to build resilience against market fluctuations, reduce idiosyncratic risks, and capture growth opportunities in different market conditions but also to enhance the effectiveness of rebalancing. Rebalancing works best when assets have low or negative correlations, as this allows the strategy to capitalize on price divergences, buying underperforming assets and selling overperforming ones, thus maintaining the portfolioâ€™s target allocation while potentially boosting returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Equity Strategies (Smart Beta)**: This includes factors such as *Value*, *Momentum*, *Quality*, *Growth*, and *Minimum Volatility*, each providing a different risk-return profile. These factors are known for their historical potential to outperform the market under specific economic conditions. For example, value stocks tend to perform well during recoveries, while momentum strategies benefit in strong upward markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Geographic and Market Diversification**: Regional equity exposures include developed markets like the *S&P 500*, global large-cap stocks, *Small Cap* equities, and *Emerging Markets*. This ensures exposure to both established economies and regions with high growth potential, balancing stability and growth opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fixed Income**: The inclusion of *US Treasuries*, *Japanese Government Bonds*, and *German Government Bonds* across different maturities offers a range of duration exposures, serving as a defensive component within the portfolio. These bonds typically perform well during periods of market uncertainty and low interest rates, providing a counterbalance to riskier assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Commodities**: *Physical Gold* and diversified *Commodity ETFs* (including ex-agriculture and livestock) are included as hedges against inflation and market downturns. Gold is a classic safe-haven asset, while broader commodity exposure captures returns from rising prices of natural resources and energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cryptocurrencies**: *Bitcoin* is included for its role as a digital store of value and its potential for high returns. It provides diversification beyond traditional assets and has gained increasing acceptance among institutional investors as a non-correlated asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sustainable Investing (SRI/ESG)**: The portfolio includes socially responsible investment options such as *SRI-focused ETFs* and *ESG-enhanced strategies*. These align with the growing demand for investments that consider environmental, social, and governance factors, catering to both ethical considerations and the potential for long-term resilience in companies with sustainable practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Safe Haven Currencies**: Exposure to currencies like the *Swiss Franc (CHF)*, *Japanese Yen (JPY)*, and the *Euro (EUR)* against the *US Dollar (USD)* helps mitigate currency risk. These currencies are traditionally considered safe havens, providing stability during periods of geopolitical tension and global financial stress."
